 * A DNS query, per RFC 1035 §4.1, padded the way DNS actually pads.

 * The padding used to be appended after the question section, which makes the
 * message malformed: with QDCOUNT 1 and every other count 0 there is nothing
 * to account for the trailing bytes, so a resolver reading the message runs
 * past what it was told to expect.
 *
 * DNS has a mechanism for exactly this. An OPT pseudo-record in the additional
 * section carries a Padding option (RFC 7830) — what DNS-over-TLS and
 * DNS-over-HTTPS clients send to hide how long a query is. So the message
 * declares ARCOUNT 1, writes the OPT record, and the `<r>` bytes that follow
 * are that option's data: a valid message, rather than a valid message with
 * rubbish stuck to the end.
