 * What actually parses I1–I5.
 *
 * The junk-packet tags were written into the client matrix, one row per app,
 * and the rows disagreed: `amneziawg-android`, `amneziawg-ios` and Amnezia VPN
 * claimed `<c>` while `amneziawg-windows` denied it — and all four ship the
 * same `amneziawg-go/v3 v3.0.1`. A tag is not a property of the app around the
 * tunnel. It is a property of the thing that reads the chain, and there are
 * only two of those in the open.
 *
 * ## The two engines, from their parsers
 *
 * `amneziawg-go`, `device/obf.go` — the `obfBuilders` map is the whole
 * vocabulary:
 *
 *     "b", "t", "r", "rc", "rd", "d", "ds", "dz"        <- no "c"
 *
 * `amneziawg-linux-kernel-module`, `src/junk.c`, `jp_parse_tags` — a chain of
 * `strcmp` ending in `else return -EINVAL`:
 *
 *     "b", "c", "t", "r", "rc", "rd"                    <- no "d", "ds", "dz"
 *
 * So the sets are disjoint in both directions: the counter tag exists only in
 * the kernel module, the data tags only in go.
 *
 * ## Why an unknown tag is not a harmless one
 *
 * Neither parser skips what it does not know. go collects the failures and
 * returns them joined, so `newObfChain` yields an error and the junk spec is
 * refused whole; the kernel module returns `-EINVAL` from `jp_parse_tags` and
 * `jp_spec_setup` propagates it. One wrong tag does not cost you that tag, it
 * costs you the packet it was in.
 *
 * ## What the versions say
 *
 * `device/obf.go` is byte-identical (blob `cf2275c5`) at v3.0.0, v3.0.1,
 * v3.0.2, v3.0.3, v3.0.20260805 and `master`, so the go vocabulary needs no
 * release axis inside 3.x. `src/junk.c` carries the same six tags on both the
 * kernel module's 1.0.x and 3.0.x lines. Checked 6 aug 2026.
