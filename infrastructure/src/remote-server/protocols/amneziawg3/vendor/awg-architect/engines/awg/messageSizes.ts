/**
 * How long a WireGuard handshake message is before AmneziaWG pads it.
 *
 * Sizes from the kernel module's `src/messages.h`, which carries WireGuard's
 * own — obfuscation adds padding on top rather than changing the structures.
 *
 * The offsets below are what the collision rules are actually about, and they
 * are derived here rather than written down three times. They were written
 * down three times, and two of the three were wrong in the same way: the
 * response's *size* had been copied in where the *difference* belonged, so
 * the tool warned about `S3 = S2 + 92` — a pair that can never collide — and
 * said nothing about `S3 = S2 + 28`, which is a real collision and, by one
 * installer maintainer's count, comes up about once in five hundred installs.
 *
 * Reported by @bivlked in issue #7, with the arithmetic worked out in full.
