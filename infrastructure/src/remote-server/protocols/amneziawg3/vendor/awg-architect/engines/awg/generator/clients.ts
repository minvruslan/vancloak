 * AmneziaWG Architect — AmneziaWG client compatibility matrix.
 *
 * Source data: upstream amneziawg-android, amneziawg-windows, amneziawg-go,
 * AmneziaVPN desktop/mobile, community firmware packages and user reports.
 *
 * The shape comes from `shared/clients`, so the same model can describe an
 * XRay core later. What it adds over a flat table is the second axis: a client
 * is not one set of limits forever. AmneziaWG for Windows refused H values
 * above 2^31-1 until v2.0.2 and takes the full range after it, and a single
 * entry could only describe one of those — so it described the broken one for
 * everybody, including people on a current build.
