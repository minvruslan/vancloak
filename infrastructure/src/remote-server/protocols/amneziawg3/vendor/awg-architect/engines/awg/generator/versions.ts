/**
 * AmneziaWG Architect — protocol version capabilities.
 *
 * The UI used to ask `version === "2.0"` in each place that needed to know
 * whether headers are ranges or S3/S4 exist. That drifts: 3.0 inherits 2.0's
 * parameter shape, so every one of those checks was a separate chance to
 * forget a version — and one of them did, which is why 3.0 rendered 1.x-shaped
 * headers while the .conf underneath was correct.
 *
 * Capabilities are declared once here instead. Adding AWG 4.0 means adding one
 * entry, not auditing every `=== "2.0"` in the codebase.
