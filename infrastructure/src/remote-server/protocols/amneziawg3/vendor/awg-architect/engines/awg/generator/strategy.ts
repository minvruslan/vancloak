 * Where each AmneziaWG parameter's value comes from.
 *
 * The generator used to draw every parameter by name, in one function, with
 * the bounds written as literals beside the draw: `rnd(1, 150)` for S1, a
 * table of H pools, an intensity map for Jmin. Adding a parameter meant
 * editing that function, and the catalogue that describes parameters had no
 * say in what got generated — which is how the config object and the rendered
 * `.conf` managed to disagree about S3 and S4.
 *
 * Here each parameter has a strategy, and the generator walks the version's
 * parameter set rather than a list it carries itself. A parameter the version
 * does not have is not drawn; a parameter with no strategy falls back to what
 * its `kind` implies. The bounds a strategy respects are the ones the
 * catalogue and the client state, not ones repeated here.
