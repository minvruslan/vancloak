/**
 * A DTLS 1.2 ClientHello.

 * Three things were wrong, all of the kind a parser hits before it looks at
 * anything interesting:
 *
 *   - The epoch was drawn from 0–255. A ClientHello is the first message of
 *     the first flight, before any cipher change, so its epoch is 0 and
 *     nothing else is possible. A random one is a giveaway, not variety.
 *   - After the handshake type came six random bytes where DTLS wants eleven
 *     structured ones — a three-byte length, a two-byte message sequence, and
 *     a three-byte fragment offset and length. Everything past that point was
 *     being read at the wrong offset.
 *   - The record length was drawn at random rather than describing the
 *     message it precedes.
 *
 * The message is unfragmented, so the fragment offset is 0 and the fragment
 * length equals the handshake length, which is what an unfragmented DTLS
 * handshake message looks like.
