/**
 * What a config actually contains, read off the catalogue.
 *
 * Two places needed this and each worked it out for itself: the parameter card
 * on the generator page and the entry written into the history. Both branched
 * on `extraSizes` / `rangedHeaders` / `cps` / `headerProtection`, both listed
 * the same fields by hand, and both had to be edited whenever a version gained
 * a parameter. They had already drifted — the card showed the 3.0 timers, the
 * history entry showed them only when set, and neither was wrong so much as
 * separately maintained.
 *
 * The catalogue already knows all of it. `paramsFor(version)` resolves the
 * version shape — H1 switching from a single value to a range at 2.0, S3 and
 * S4 appearing at 2.0, the CPS chain at 1.5, the 3.0 block at 3.0 — and each
 * entry carries the field to read and the block it belongs to. So this walks
 * that, and the two callers stop deciding anything.
