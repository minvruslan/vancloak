/**
 * The vocabulary every protocol in Architect is described with.
 *
 * AmneziaWG and XRay have nothing in common at the level of individual
 * parameters — there is no REALITY counterpart to Jc, and no AmneziaWG
 * counterpart to a transport. What they do share is the set of *questions*
 * worth asking about a parameter: what shape is its value, which version
 * introduced it, and who needs to know it.
 *
 * That last question is the one this file exists for. It is not a naming
 * convention, it is a property of the protocol, and getting it wrong is what
 * makes a tunnel fail with no error at all:
 *
 *   - AmneziaWG: `device/receive.go` identifies an incoming packet using the
 *     receiver's *own* S and H values, so those must match on both ends.
 *     Junk packets and the I chain are only ever sent, never parsed.
 *   - XRay: `infra/conf/transport_security.go` rejects a client config that
 *     carries `serverNames`, and the REALITY keys must pair up — while the
 *     XHTTP padding knobs are applied by whoever sends.
 *
 * Same three classes, two unrelated protocols. That is why it is here and not
 * in either engine.
