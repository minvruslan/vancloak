/**
 * What a hostname is, to a tool that hides traffic behind one.
 *
 * Both engines lean on real domain names, for two different jobs:
 *
 *   - AmneziaWG builds junk packets that imitate a handshake toward a name.
 *     The name has to be one a client there would plausibly contact, and the
 *     protocol has to be one the host actually speaks — a QUIC packet aimed at
 *     a host with no HTTP/3 is a packet nobody could have sent.
 *   - XRay's REALITY borrows a real site's TLS handshake wholesale. That site
 *     has to speak TLS 1.3 and HTTP/2, must not sit behind the same CDN as the
 *     server pretending to be it, and must answer without redirecting away.
 *
 * The lists that fed both were flat arrays of strings, chosen once and never
 * checked. A host that dropped HTTP/3, moved behind Cloudflare, or started
 * redirecting stayed in the pool and quietly made the traffic worse. So a
 * domain is a record with facts attached, and the facts say when they were
 * last established and from where.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE
 *
 * No HTTP status code, and no reachability flag. Both are properties of the
 * path between a vantage point and a host rather than of the host: a Chinese
 * CDN that ignores a Russian address has not said it lacks HTTP/3, and a site
 * that answers 301 today answers 200 next week. This database says what a host
 * *supports*; whether it is up and reachable right now is a live question, and
 * a live question deserves a live check at the moment of use.
