 * What an engine reports about a config.
 *
 * A finding is the product's actual output as much as the config text is:
 * generating parameters is easy, and saying which rule a config breaks is the
 * part that saves someone an evening. So a finding is data, not a sentence —
 * it carries a code and the values that go in the message, and the message is
 * produced later, in whatever language the reader is using.
 *
 * That split is new. Findings used to carry a hardcoded Russian string, which
 * meant an English reader saw Russian, and the `code` field the UI could have
 * translated was never used.
