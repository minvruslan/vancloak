 * One browser, described once, used by both engines.
 *
 * AmneziaWG and XRay both imitate browsers, but they imitate different parts
 * of one. AmneziaWG copies UDP payload *sizes*, because that is all its
 * padding can control. XRay copies the TLS ClientHello, by naming a uTLS
 * profile. Same browsers, two facets — so the browser is described once here
 * and each engine reads the facet it can use.
 *
 * The uTLS names come from `transport/internet/tls/tls.go` in Xray-core, which
 * sorts them into three tiers with meanings worth preserving:
 *
 *   - preset   what GUI clients offer, and what `chrome` etc. resolve to
 *   - modern   the pool `random` draws from at startup
 *   - other    Golang, randomised, and per the code comment "too old"
 *
 * REALITY separately refuses `unsafe` and `hellogolang`, so neither appears
 * here at all.
