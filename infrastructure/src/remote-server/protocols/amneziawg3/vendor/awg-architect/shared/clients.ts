 * What the thing on the other end can actually accept.
 *
 * A config is only correct relative to what will read it. AmneziaWG has
 * clients that cap a field the protocol does not; XRay has cores that reject a
 * mode a later one added. Both are the same question — "which build is this
 * for?" — so the shape lives here and each protocol supplies its own limits.
 *
 * The part that needed generalising is the second axis. A client is not one
 * set of limits forever: AmneziaWG for Windows refused H values above 2^31-1
 * until v2.0.2 and accepts the full range after it. One entry per client could
 * only describe one of those, so it described the broken one for everybody.
